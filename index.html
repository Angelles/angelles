        <h1>My Placeholder Practice Page</h1>
        <h2>About This Page</h2>
        <p>I am learning how to make a webpage in Cloud 9 and put it on Github as a part of a WIT study hall. So, I will be using new code as I learn it on this placeholder practice page.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I work in education. My hobbies include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://freshlysewn.wordpress.com" target="_blank">sewing</a></li>
            <li>baking</li>
            <li>learning HTML and CSS (and eventually other languages).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I welcome help from anyone who is willing to offer it.</p>
